= Source Grabber =
----

Not nice or clean but I hope useful tool for automatic updates of packages using GIT or SVN repositories. It is meant more like bash function library and process skeleton which can be used to addapt for specific cases.

* source_grabber.sh - currently bash library you need to source
* config.d/base.conf - non repository specific configuration
* config.d/e17.repo - working example (not the smallest one though)
